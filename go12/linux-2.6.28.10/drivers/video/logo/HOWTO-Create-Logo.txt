To create the clut224.ppm file necessary for the logo, you need to install the netpbm 
utility suite (either under cygwin or linux).

You can then do something like the following to convert a PNG file into a CLUT file:

pngtopnm logo.png | pnmtoplainpnm > logo_linux_clut224.ppm

If the original image has more than 224 colors, then you may need to use one of the following
techniques to quantize the image:

pngtopnm logo.png | ppmquant -fs 223 | pnmtoplainpnm > logo_linux_clut224.ppm

ppmquant uses a dithering technique to create the intermediary colors.

Alternatively you can use the convert utility that comes with ImageMagick:

convert -colors 224 src.png dest.png

This will reduce the colorspace and not do any dithering. Which technique looks better
will depend largely on the content.

You can either overwrite one of the linux logo filenames (see the Makefile in drivers/video/logo)
or edit the Makefile to add a new entry and add a new entry for a new file.
