config LTT
	bool "Linux Trace Toolkit Instrumentation Support"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL
	depends on TRACEPOINTS
	depends on MARKERS
	default y
	help
	  It is possible for the kernel to log important events to a trace
	  facility. Doing so enables the use of the generated traces in order
	  to reconstruct the dynamic behavior of the kernel, and hence the
	  whole system.

	  The tracing process contains 4 parts :
	      1) The logging of events by key parts of the kernel.
	      2) The tracer that keeps the events in a data buffer (uses
	         relay).
	      3) A trace daemon that interacts with the tracer and is
	         notified every time there is a certain quantity of data to
	         read from the tracer.
	      4) A trace event data decoder that reads the accumulated data
	         and formats it in a human-readable format.

	  If you say Y, the first component will be built into the kernel.

config LTT_TRACEPROBES
	tristate "Compile lttng tracing probes"
	depends on LTT
	default m
	help
	  Compile lttng tracing probes, which connect to the tracepoints when
	  loaded and format the information collected by the tracepoints with
	  the Markers.

config HAVE_LTT_DUMP_TABLES
	def_bool n

config LTT_RELAY_ALLOC

config LTT_RELAY
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit High-speed Lockless Data Relay"
	select DEBUG_FS
	select LTT_RELAY_ALLOC
	depends on LTT_TRACER
	default y
	help
	  Support using the fast lockless algorithm to log the data obtained
	  through LTT.

	  If you don't have special hardware, you almost certainly want
	  to say Y here.

config LTT_RELAY_LOCKED
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit Lock-Protected Data Relay"
	select DEBUG_FS
	select LTT_RELAY_ALLOC
	depends on LTT_TRACER
	default n
	help
	  Support using the slow spinlock and interrupt disable algorithm to log
	  the data obtained through LTT.

config LTT_RELAY_CHECK_RANDOM_ACCESS
	bool "Debug check for random access in ltt relay buffers"
	depends on LTT_RELAY
	default n
	help
	  Add checks for random access to LTTng relay buffers. Given those
	  buffers are a linked list, such access are rather slow. Rare accesses
	  are OK; they can be caused by large writes (more than a page large) or
	  by reentrancy (e.g. interrupt nesting over the tracing code).

config LTT_SERIALIZE
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit Serializer"
	default y
	depends on LTT
	help
	  Library for serializing information from format string and argument
	  list to the trace buffers.

config LTT_MARKER_CONTROL
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit Marker Control"
	depends on LTT_SERIALIZE
	default y
	help
	  Interface (/proc/ltt) to enable markers.

config LTT_TRACER
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit Tracer"
	depends on LTT
	depends on LTT_MARKER_CONTROL
	default y
	help
	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit Tracer will be
	  either built in the kernel or as module.

	  Critical parts of the kernel will call upon the kernel tracing
	  function. The data is then recorded by the tracer if a trace daemon
	  is running in user-space and has issued a "start" command.

	  For more information on kernel tracing, the trace daemon or the event
	  decoder, please check the following address :
	       http://www.opersys.com/ltt
	  See also the experimental page of the project :
	       http://ltt.polymtl.ca

config LTT_ALIGNMENT
	bool "Align Linux Trace Toolkit Traces"
	depends on LTT
	default y
	help
	  This option enables dynamic alignment of data in buffers. The
	  alignment is made on the smallest size between architecture size
	  and the size of the value to be written.

	  Dynamically calculating the offset of the data has a performance cost,
	  but it is more efficient on some architectures (especially 64 bits) to
	  align data than to write it unaligned.

config LTT_DEBUG_EVENT_SIZE
	bool "Add event size field to LTT events for tracer debugging"
	depends on LTT
	default n
	help
	  Tracer-internal option to help debugging event type encoding problems.

config LTT_VMCORE
	bool "Support trace extraction from crash dump"
	depends on LTT
	default y
	help
	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit Tracer will
	  support extacting ltt log from vmcore, which can be generated with
	  kdump or LKCD tools.

	  Special crash extension should be used to extract ltt buffers.

config LTT_NETLINK_CONTROL
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit Netlink Controller"
	depends on LTT_TRACER
	depends on NET
	default m
	help
	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit Netlink Controller
	  will be either built in the kernel or as module.

config LTT_STATEDUMP
	tristate "Linux Trace Toolkit State Dump"
	depends on LTT_TRACER
	default m
	help
	  If you enable this option, the Linux Trace Toolkit State Dump will
	  be either built in the kernel or as module.

	  This module saves the state of the running kernel at trace start
	  into the trace buffers along with the ongoing tracing information.

config LTT_FTRACE
	bool "Linux Trace Toolkit Ftrace Support"
	depends on LTT_TRACER
	depends on FTRACE
	default y
	help
	  Integration of function entry trace with LTTng. Connect the
	  ftrace_cpu_start and ftrace_cpu_stop probes to markers to start/stop
	  function tracing while a trace is being taken. Typically used when the
	  surroundings of a problem has been identified in a prior trace.
